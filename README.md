# Extended Number System
Here's the Extended Number System That I am Working On
-- BigInt: Big Integer Implementation in C++

In C++, numbers are stored in either 32- or 64-bit architecture. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for people who want to utilize integers exceeding this figure. My project tries to address this problem by introducing an extended number system that literally allows a large number of bits for integers (within the limit of being able to be stored by processor, of course). 

Current progress: basic input/output and arithmetic done (albeit still have some bugs on subtraction). Pending: a rigorous test system.
